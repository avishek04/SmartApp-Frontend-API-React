# Getting Started with Create React App
This project has session login feature to track the number of requests made by the user. It uses CLARIFIA's facial recognition API to locate the portrait in the image when the image URL is submitted and display it in the UI.  
  
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
  
The backend(NodeJS) of the project is found [here](https://github.com/avishek04/SmartApp-Backend-API-NodeJS).
